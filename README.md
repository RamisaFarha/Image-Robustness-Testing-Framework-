# Image-Robustness-Testing-Framework-
A Python pipeline to stress-test images (JPEG, crop, rotation, Gaussian noise, blur) and quantify degradation with PSNR/SSIM/Edge-SSIM. Produced CSV summaries, trend plots, and before/after panels across severities; design directly reusable for watermark robustness evaluation.
